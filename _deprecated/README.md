# Deprecated Scripts

The scripts in this folder are "deprecated." This means that they are not a part of the current workflow either because (A) they have been superseded by a script that _is_ in the current workflow or (B) they explore methods/operations that turned out to not be needed.

These scripts are preserved here for posterity but because they are not practically useful no explanations are provided.
